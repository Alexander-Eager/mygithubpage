Hi Joseph Chen,

I am part of a CSCI 401 group at USC which is supposed to continue working on the summer camp project for Professor Miller, but unfortunately the repository has been deactivated because your GitHub student account expired.  Can you transfer ownership to Professor Miller, so that way the repository stays active?  If you get this message, my email is alalalalalalalalak@gmail.com (spam email since I don't want to get spambots hitting my main email).

Thanks,

Alex Eager
